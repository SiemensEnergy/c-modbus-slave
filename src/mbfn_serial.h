/**
 * @brief Reads the exception status of a Modbus slave device
 *
 * Implements Modbus function code 0x07 (Read Exception Status) which is a serial-only function.
 * This function returns device-specific exception status information as defined by the slave.
 * The exception status is typically used to indicate error conditions, communication problems,
 * or device-specific diagnostic information.
 *
 * @param inst Modbus instance containing configuration and callback
 * @param req Pointer to the request PDU (function code + request data)
 * @param req_len Length of the request PDU (expected to be 1 - just function code)
 * @param res Pointer to the response PDU structure to populate
 *
 * @retval MB_OK Success - exception status read and response prepared
 * @retval MB_DEV_FAIL Invalid parameters or callback not configured
 * @retval MB_ILLEGAL_DATA_VAL Invalid request format (length != 1)
 *
 * @note This function requires inst->serial.read_exception_status_cb to be configured
 * @note This is a serial-only function and not applicable for TCP/IP communication
 * @note The meaning of status bits is device-specific and defined by the implementer
 * @note Request format: [function_code] - No additional data required
