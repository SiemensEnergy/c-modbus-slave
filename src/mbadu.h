 * @brief Modbus Application Data Unit (Serial) - ADU wrapper with slave address and CRC
 * @author Jonas Alm√•s
 *
 * @details This module provides serial Modbus Application Data Unit handling.
 * It wraps the Protocol Data Unit (PDU) with slave address and CRC-16 checksum
 * for use in Modbus RTU serial communications.
 *
 * @note Format: [slave_addr][PDU][crc16] - Used for Modbus RTU (RS485/RS232)
 * @see mbpdu.h for the underlying PDU implementation

 * Processes a complete Modbus Application Data Unit for serial communication (RTU mode).

 * @param inst Pointer to the Modbus instance containing coil/register maps and configuration
 * @param req Pointer to received ADU data (slave_addr + PDU + CRC)
 * @param req_len Size of received ADU data in bytes (expected between MBADU_SIZE_MIN and MBADU_SIZE_MAX)
 * @param res Pointer to response buffer (must be at least MBADU_SIZE_MAX bytes)
 *
 * @return Size of response data in bytes, or 0 if no response should be sent
 *
 * @note ADU format: [slave_addr][function_code][pdu_data...][crc_lo][crc_hi]
 * @note Responds to slave_addr, broadcast address (0), and optionally address 248 if enabled
 * @note Broadcast requests (address 0) never generate responses
 * @note Returns 0 for invalid requests, CRC errors, or broadcast messages
 * @note Response buffer must be allocated by caller with sufficient space (MBADU_SIZE_MAX)
