 * @brief Modbus Protocol Data Unit (PDU) - Function code routing and request handling
 * @author Jonas Alm√•s
 *
 * @details This module handles the protocol layer of Modbus by routing function
 * codes to the appropriate handlers. Defines PDU structure, status codes,
 * function codes, and provides the main request processing interface for all
 * Modbus operations.
 *
 * @note PDU format: [function_code][data...] - Core protocol without transport wrapper
 * @see mbinst.h for instance configuration

 * @brief Modbus PDU Buffer
 *
 * A buffer management structure used to build Modbus PDU responses and track
 * the amount of data written.
 *
 * The PDU data follows the standard Modbus format:
 * [function_code][pdu_data...]
 *
 * @note The buffer pointed to by 'p' must be allocated with at least
 *       MBPDU_SIZE_MAX bytes to accommodate the largest possible PDU
 * @note The 'size' field tracks bytes actually used, not buffer capacity
 * @note See MBPDU_SIZE_MAX for maximum PDU size constant

/**
 * @brief Handle Modbus PDU request
 *
 * Processes a Modbus Protocol Data Unit by routing the function code to the
 * appropriate handler and generating a response. Supports all standard Modbus
 * function codes for reading/writing coils and registers, with fallback to
 * custom function handlers.
 *
 * @param inst Pointer to the Modbus instance containing coil/register maps and configuration
 * @param req Pointer to the complete PDU data (function code + request data)
 * @param req_len Length of the PDU data in bytes (expected >= 1)
 * @param res Pointer to response PDU data to populate (must be at least MBPDU_SIZE_MAX bytes)
 *
 * @return Size of response data in bytes, or 0 if no response should be sent
 *
 * @note PDU format: [function_code][request_data...]
 * @note On error, sets error flag (0x80) in response function code and includes error code
 * @note Calls custom function handler 'handle_fn_cb' (if present) for unsupported or missing function codes
 * @note Response PDU is always populated, even on errors
