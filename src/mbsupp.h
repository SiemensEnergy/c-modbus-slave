/**
 * @brief Calculate Modbus RTU frame break time in microseconds
 *
 * Calculates the minimum inter-frame break time required for Modbus RTU
 * communication according to the Modbus specification. The break time is
 * based on 3.5 character times, where each character consists of 11 bits
 * (1 start + 8 data + 1 parity + 1 stop).
 *
 * @param baud Serial baud rate in bits per second (e.g., 9600, 19200, 115200)
 * @return Break time in microseconds, minimum 1750µs for higher baud rates
 *
 * @note For baud rates above ~19200, a minimum of 1.75ms is enforced as recommended
 * @note Used for RTU frame detection and inter-frame spacing in serial communication
 * @note Formula: max(1750µs, (1,000,000 * 11 * 3.5) / baud_rate)
